# Robotics-Projects
project1: publish and subscribe custom messages.

tf2_examples: basic example using the tf2 package for coordinate system's transformations.

project2_solution: program that uses tf to describe the poses between a robot, its camera and an object.

marker_publisher: used in project2_solution to visualize the transformations. It's invoked by project2_solution.

project3: packages that analyze the forward dynamics of a Kuka LBR iiwa arm.

project4/cartesian_control: also with the package robot_sim from project3, uses the differential kinematics of the Kuka LBR iiwa robot arm.

project5: In order for the robot end-effector to reach a desired pose without collisions with any obstacles present in its environment it's necessary to implement motion planning. In this project is used a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) motion planner for the same 7-jointed robot arm of the previous lectures.
